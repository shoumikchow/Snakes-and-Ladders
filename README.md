# Snakes-and-Ladders


This was made as part of my CSE310 (Object Oriented Programming) course in BRAC University in Fall 2014. 

This is a Snakes and Ladders game that is played between two people, each taking turns one after another. A dice is rolled, action performed by the Roll button, which picks a number in random from 1 to 6. The player does not enter the board until or unless he scores a 1. That is, the player keeps rolling and their score remains zero unless the dice shows “1”. The score increases till 100, encountering Snakes and Ladders. When a player scores 100, the scoring stops and a winner is declared.


Note: It should be noted that due to a Netbeans bug, when the application is run, the button and the text fields on the right of the board is not shown. The mouse should be hovered to the place where the “Roll” button is located and clicked twice in order to reveal all the fields.

**Language used:**

* Java
